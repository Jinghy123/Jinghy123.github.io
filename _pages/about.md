<h2 id="about">About</h2>

I am a second-year CS master student at [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), working with [Prof. Yue Wang](https://yuewang.xyz/) at [Physical Superintelligence(PSI) Lab](https://psi-lab.ai/). My research mainly focuses on Robotics, particularly **whole-body humanoid control** and **dexterous manipulation**. I aim to develop intelligent systems that enable humanoid robots to perform coordinated, dynamic, and physically interactive tasks in the real world.

Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Prof. Xiang Xiang](https://eglxiang.github.io/). I also served as an research intern in [MINE Lab](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/) led by [Prof.Xiangliang Zhang](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/xiangliang-zhang/) at [Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu/) during my senior year.

I am looking for Fall 2026 PhD opportunities and open to discuss potential research collaborations. Please contact me if you're interested!
